# Find the maximum of a list of numbers
## Aim:
To write a program to find the maximum of a list of numbers.
## Equipment’s required:
1.	Hardware – PCs
2.	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
1.	Get the list of marks as input
2.	Use the sort() function or max() function or use the for loop to find the maximum mark.
3.	Return the maximum value
## Program:

i)	# To find the maximum of marks using the list method sort.
```Python
DEVELOPED BY:MANGARI DEERAJ
REGISTER NUMBER:212223100031
def max_marks(x):
    x.sort()
    large=x[-1]
    return large
```

ii)	# To find the maximum marks using the list method max().
```Python
DEVELOPED BY:MANGARI DEERAJ
REGISTER NUMBER:212223100031
def max_marks(i):
    i.sort()
    large=i[-1]
    return large

```

iii) # To find the maximum marks without using builtin functions.
```Python
DEVELOPED BY:MANGARI DEERAJ
REGISTER NUMBER:212223100031
def max_marks(mark):
    mark.sort()
    large=mark[-1]
    return large

```



## Output:
To find the maximum of marks using the list method sort.

## Result:
Thus the program to find the maximum of given numbers from the list is written and verified using python programming.
